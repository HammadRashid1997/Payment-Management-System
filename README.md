# ðŸ’° Payment-Management-System

# Chapter 1: Introduction

The Payment Management System is a crucial application designed to serve as a seamless gateway between two registered banks, facilitating efficient payment processing. With the growing need for secure and convenient financial transactions, this system aims to bridge the gap and streamline payment operations between various banks, offering a user-friendly experience for both customers and administrators.

By maintaining registered accounts linked to specific banks and currencies, the system ensures a high level of financial transparency and accuracy. For ease of use, the initial account balance will begin at 3000.0, and the supported currencies will include PKR, EUR, and USD, with constant conversion rates between them.

The system will cater to two types of users: administrators and regular users. Administrators will have extensive privileges, including creating and managing banks, accessing account details, payment history, and payment status. On the other hand, regular users will be able to sign up, create accounts, perform transactions between registered banks, and manage their own account information securely.

Overall, this Payment Management System promises to revolutionize financial interactions, ensuring convenience, security, and efficiency for all users involved.

- The emphasis on speed vs memory because the users would prefer an application that runs fast and is quick in response.
- The application should give a good feel so as to leave a good aesthetic impression on the users and so that they can use it again and again.
- The application should be user-friendly for all types of users so that every person can use it efficiently.

### 4.2.4. Development Methods

The methodology used in making this application is the waterfall development methodology. Waterfall methodology is used in making the application as the project guidelines are given and clear. Also, the requirements will not change, thus waterfall methodology is the best.

## 4.3. Architectural Strategies

To develop a Web Application, we will be using Java. The user interface of our application will be designed according to the user convention and will be user-friendly. The color selection will be done carefully considering all the factors and types of people who would be using our application.

Our system will have some error screens as well. The framework will be Struts2 framework. On the front end, JSP pages will be created to bind the actions with their respective functionality. Also, at the back end, Java classes and Java Action classes will be used. The database used is an in-memory H2 database.

# Chapter 6: Implementation and Test Cases

This chapter talks about the implementation details for the prototype designed for the application and the test cases and their descriptions. Also, it enlists the test metrics which have been used and fulfilled.

## 6.1. Design Implementation

The application will start with the welcome page which has a login page where the user and admin will be allowed to enter his credentials. If the user is new to the application, then he will be asked to signup page. The guest user will be allowed to enter his credentials and then proceed to the login page. The admin can only login with the given credentials as there is only one admin, while the user has to signup before login. So, for this purpose, once the application runs, only one user can create his account. When the admin logs in to the portal, he will be allowed to view several options such as create banks, list accounts etc. On the other hand, the user will be allowed to perform several functions such as create an account and list banks. Both the user and admin roles have a logout button which will be used to sign out from the application.

## 6.2. Test Case Design and Description
This section lists all the important test cases along with their descriptions in a tabular form, the standard format followed in the industry.
