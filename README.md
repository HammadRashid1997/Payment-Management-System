# Chapter 1: Introduction

The Payment Management System is a crucial application designed to serve as a seamless gateway between two registered banks, facilitating efficient payment processing. With the growing need for secure and convenient financial transactions, this system aims to bridge the gap and streamline payment operations between various banks, offering a user-friendly experience for both customers and administrators.

By maintaining registered accounts linked to specific banks and currencies, the system ensures a high level of financial transparency and accuracy. For ease of use, the initial account balance will begin at 3000.0, and the supported currencies will include PKR, EUR, and USD, with constant conversion rates between them.

The system will cater to two types of users: administrators and regular users. Administrators will have extensive privileges, including creating and managing banks, accessing account details, payment history, and payment status. On the other hand, regular users will be able to sign up, create accounts, perform transactions between registered banks, and manage their own account information securely.

Overall, this Payment Management System promises to revolutionize financial interactions, ensuring convenience, security, and efficiency for all users involved.

â€¢ Provide a platform to the users to transfer payments.
â€¢ Provide a hassle-free environment to the people to make their payments secure.
â€¢ Allow the users to enter their credentials and access multiple banks.

## 2.4. Project Scope
The main technology being used is Java along with Struts2 framework. The front end and back-end will be done using JavaScript, HTML, CSS and Java. The web server used is Apache Tomcat.

## 2.5. Constraints
